      <b>Doing the Conduction Expirement</b></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Get the butter and cut it into two thin slices</li>
      <li>Get the wooden spoon and tie one slice of butter to the top of the handle it with string</li>
      <li>Do the same as step 2 but with the steel spoon </li>
      <li>Put both the spoons inside the bowl head (curvy part) first</li>
      <li>Put the bowl on the stove and turn it (the stove) on</li>
      <li>Set a timer for each spoon</li>
      <Li>Press stop on the certain spoon timer when that spoon's butter has gone halfway down the handle</Li>
      <li>Record the time for each spoon</li>
      <p><b>Explanation</b></p>
      In the expirement above, you saw that the metal spoon's butter melted faster than the wooden spoon's. Why is that? The reason being is that metal is more densely packed than wood's. When heat is applied to an object, the molecules inside start to vibrate. When the metal's tightly packed molecules start to vibrate, they create more friction and more energy is created too. Because of this, the metal heats up fast. Another reason is because of the surface. If a surface is rough and uneven, then contact and heat connection are interrupted by gaps. Wood is full of microscopic gaps at its surface. Metal is smooth and has fewer gaps. This is why the heat on the metal spoon reached the butter faster and melted it. You can see CONDUCTION in your everyday life. People don't use wooden cooking pans often because the food inside won't heat up fast. But they do use wooden spoons to stir food because their hand won't burn as easily as with a metal spoon. Conduction can be very useful in life. But so can radiation. Let's take a look at it.
